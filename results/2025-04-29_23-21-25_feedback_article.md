Regrettably, there were also some negative comments. An ambiguous Trip Advisor review rated a Giraffas location in Curitiba 3.5 out of 5 without much detail, and an anonymous employee on Indeed mentioned lacking enjoyment in their job, citing poor benefits and resources *(source: [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Giraffas-2))*.
